        I&apos;m someone who always loved to build things and found the perfect way of doing
        that in coding. Therefore, I&apos;m working on several projects in my free time and
        try to learn new things and becoming more experienced in the technologies and coding
        languages I use üßë‚Äçüíª.

      <StyledParagraph>
        Besides coding, I also love to go biking, traveling and to produce electronic music. Of
        course, eating is also playing a huge role. When I&apos;m not walking through Berlin
        (or other cities) to find new great restaurants, you will find me in the kitchen trying
        out new receipts üçõ.
